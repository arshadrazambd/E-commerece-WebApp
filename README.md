# E-Commerce WebApp

I have successfully developed an e-commerce project using a technology stack that includes HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. For seamless and secure payments, I integrated Braintree. This combination of technologies provides a solid foundation for a dynamic and interactive e-commerce platform, ensuring scalability and a user-friendly experience.

## Features

### Register, Login, and Forgot Password Page
Developed a user authentication system with register, login, and forgot password functionalities. This ensures secure access to authorized users while safeguarding sensitive information. Encryption and verification processes add an extra layer of security.
